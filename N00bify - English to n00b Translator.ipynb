Excluding: All punctuation and any 1's added after exclamation marks ( ! ). Character count includes spaces.\n","\n","2 For the sake of this kata, \"words\" are simply a space-delimited substring, regardless of its characters. Since the output may have a different number of words than the input, words should be counted based on the output string.\n","\n","Example: whoa, you are my 123 <3 becomes LOL WHOA u R my 123 <3 = 7 words\n","\n","3The incoming string will be punctuated properly, so punctuation does not need to be validated.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VCkmp517JGb-","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def n00bify(text):\n","    \n","    mod_text = text\n","\n","    for i, j in [('too', '2'), ('to', '2'), ('fore', '4'), ('for', '4'), ('oo', '00'), (\"be\", 'b'), (\"are\", 'r'), (\"you\", 'u'), \n","                 (\"please\", 'plz'), (\"people\", 'ppl'), (\"really\", 'rly'), (\"have\", 'haz'), (\"know\", 'no'), ('s', 'z')]:\n","        \n","        mod_text = mod_text.replace(i, j)\n","    \n","    if 'w' in text[0]:\n","        mod_text = 'LOL '+ mod_text\n","\n","    if len(text) > 32:\n","        \n","        mod_text = 'OMG '+ mod_text\n","        \n","    \n","    mod_text = mod_text.split(' ')\n","    \n","    for i, j in enumerate(mod_text):\n","\n","        if i%2 != 0:\n","            mod_text[i] = j.upper() \n","    \n","    mod_text = ' '.join(mod_text)\n","    \n","    if 'h' in text[0]:\n","         \n","        mod_text = mod_text.upper()\n","\n","    for i in [',', '.', \"'\"]:\n","        mod_text = mod_text.replace(i, '')\n","    print(mod_text)\n","    mod_text = mod_text.replace('?',''.join(['?' for i in range(len(mod_text.split(' ')))]))\n","\n","    mod_text = mod_text.replace('!',''.join(['1' if i%2 !=0 else '!' for i in range(len(mod_text.split(' ')))]))   \n","\n","    return mod_text"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"u6C9rKGIUtRQ","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"outputId":"e2b81a25-7be5-44eb-bbc2-6ce4c4403b0d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1592249505268,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":394,"user":{"displayName":"Mathew Menachery","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiHPiWJ_3oXeFpjhk78bPH6GVuao5foMjJCZq9aZQ=s64","userId":"03586594763766489144"}}},"source":["n00bify('Hi, how are you today?') == 'HI HOW R U 2DAY?????'"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Hi HOW r U 2day?\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["False"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mptm2NvCXWg6","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"outputId":"788a18cf-69cf-4f4b-a414-abd87bddb048","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1592249505274,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":384,"user":{"displayName":"Mathew Menachery","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiHPiWJ_3oXeFpjhk78bPH6GVuao5foMjJCZq9aZQ=s64","userId":"03586594763766489144"}}},"source":["n00bify('I think it would be nice if we could all get along.') == 'OMG I think IT would B nice IF we COULD all GET along'\n"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["OMG I think IT would B nice IF we COULD all GET along\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9DcY7lw6Zxkz","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"outputId":"5e4df7fd-7fab-493a-eb29-7a0bf841a2ce","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1592249505279,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":379,"user":{"displayName":"Mathew Menachery","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiHPiWJ_3oXeFpjhk78bPH6GVuao5foMjJCZq9aZQ=s64","userId":"03586594763766489144"}}},"source":["n00bify(\"Let's eat, Grandma!\") == 'Letz EAT Grandma!1!'\n"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Letz EAT Grandma!\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NGkyIWYBb1Dj","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
